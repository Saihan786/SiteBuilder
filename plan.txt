Tasks in order of priority
    Find all dependencies and pip install them and add to requirements.txt (doesn't it do this automatically?)

    Fix overall page structure layout to be more consistent and closer to the general standard
    Fix grid layout (card bootstrap page for the grid organisation section to structure it better) (turn into reusable block after) and add tests
    Add descriptors for all tests (current comments don't show up in terminal when tests are run)
    Fix search button and add tests
    Fix delete button and add tests
